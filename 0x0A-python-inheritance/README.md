0x09. Python - Everything is object
 -----------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesom
- What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
- What is a subclass
- How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
- When can an instance have new attributes
- How to inherit class from another
- How to define a class with multiple base classes
- What is the default class every class inherit from
- How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
- Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
- What is the purpose of inheritance
- What are, when and how to use `isinstance`, `issubclass`, `type` and `super` built-in functions.

Requirements
Python Scriptss
 ------------------------
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`

Files
 ---------------------------
 The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-answer.txt` | What function would you use to print the type of an object? Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`. |
| `1-answer.txt` |  How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)? Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`. |
| `2-answer.txt` | In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`
`>>> b = 100` |
| `3-answer.txt` |  In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`                       `>>> b = 89` |
