0x07. Python - Test-driven development
 -----------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- Whatâ€™s an interactive test
- Why tests are important
- How to write Docstrings to create tests
- How to write documentation for each module and function
- What are the basic option flags to create tests
- How to find edge cases.

Technologies
 ------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`

Files
