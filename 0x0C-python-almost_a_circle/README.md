0x0C. Python - Almost a circle
 -----------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file- What is `*args` and how to use it
- What is `**kwargs` and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
 
Requirements
Python Scripts
 ------------------------
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
-  
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`
- All your modules should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- All your classes should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should be documented: `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)

Python Test Cases
  --------------------------
- Allowed editors:`vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- You have to use the [` unittest module`](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/unittest.html#module-unittest)
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.py`)
- All your test files and folders should start with `test_`
- Your file organization in the tests folder should be the same as your project: ex: for `models/base.py`, unit tests must be in: `tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m unittest discover tests`
- You can also test file by file by using this command: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_models/test_base.py`
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases so that you don’t miss any edge case

Files
 ---------------------------
 The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/` | All your files, classes and methods must be unit tested and be PEP 8 validated. |
