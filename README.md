High Level Programming, Data Structure and Algorithms
  --------------------------
Higher-level programming, Data Structure & algorithms carried out during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX_Africa/Holberton_School.**

Technologies
 ------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are interpreted/compiled using python3 `3.8.5`
- Tested on Ubuntu `20.04 LTS`
- Python files are written according to the `pycodestyle 2.10.0`

Projects
 ----------------------------
The following are project folders done in the course of the study:

| Project name | Description |
| --- | ---|
| [`0x00. Python - Hello, World`](https://github.com/elishakuje/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x00-python-hello_world) | Introduction to python programming Language. How to use the Python interpreter, How to print text and variables using print, How to use string, What are indexing and slicing in Python, and What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle |
| [`0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions`](https://github.com/elishakuje/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x01-python-if_else_loops_functions) | Project aims at learning about Indentation, `if, if ... else` statements, comments, values of variables, `while` and `for` loops, `breaks` and `continue` statements, etc. |
| [`0x02. Python - import & modules`](https://github.com/elishakuje/alx-higher_level_programming/tree/master/0x02-python-import_modules) | This Project is aimed at learning how to:
 - import functions from another file
 - use imported functions
 - create a module
 - use the built-in function `dir()`
 - prevent code in your script from being executed when imported
 - use command line arguments with your Python programs |
