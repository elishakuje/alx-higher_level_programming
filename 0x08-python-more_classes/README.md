- “first-class everything”
- What is a class
- What is an object and an instance
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is an attribute
- What are and how to use public, protected and private attributes

- What is and what does contain `__dict__` of a class and of an instance of a class
- How does Python find the attributes of an object or class

Technologies
 ------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`

Files
 ---------------------------
 The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ` 0-rectangle.py` | Write an empty class Rectangle that defines a rectangle. |
| `1-answer.txt` |  How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)? Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`. |
| `2-answer.txt` | In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`
`>>> b = 100` |
| `3-answer.txt` |  In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`                       `>>> b = 89` |
