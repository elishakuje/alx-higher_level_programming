0x08. Python - More Classes and Objects
 -----------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesom
- What is an object
- What is the difference between a class and an object or instance
- What is the difference between immutable object and mutable object
- What is a reference
- What is an assignment
- What is an alias
- How to know if two variables are identical
- How to know if two variables are linked to the same object
- How to display the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)
- What is mutable and immutable
- What are the built-in mutable types
- What are the built-in immutable types
- How does Python pass variables to functions

Technologies
 ------------------------
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`

Files
 ---------------------------
 The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-answer.txt` | What function would you use to print the type of an object? Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`. |
| `1-answer.txt` |  How do you get the variable identifier (which is the memory address in the CPython implementation)? Write the name of the function in the file, without `()`. |
| `2-answer.txt` | In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`
`>>> b = 100` |
| `3-answer.txt` |  In the following code, do `a` and `b` point to the same object? answer `Yes` or `No`. `>>> a = 89`                       `>>> b = 89` |
