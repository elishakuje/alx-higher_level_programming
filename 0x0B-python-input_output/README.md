0x0B. Python - Input/Output
 -----------------
This Project was done during Full Stack Software Engineering studies @ alx africa. it aims was to learn about:-
- Why Python programming is awesom
- How to open a file
- How to write text in a file
- How to read the full content of a file
- How to read a file line by line
- How to move the cursor in a file
- How to make sure a file is closed after using it
- What is and how to use the `with` statement
- What is `JSON`
- What is serialization
- What is deserialization
- How to convert a Python data structure to a JSON string

Requirements
Python Scriptss
 ------------------------
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- Scripts written in Bash `5.0.17(1)`
- All Python files are intepreted using `Python3 (3.8.5)`
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- All codes tested with `pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)`
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using `wc`

Python Test Cases
  --------------------------
- Allowed editors:`vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All your files should end with a new line
All your test files should be inside a folder `tests`
- All your test files should be text files (extension: `.txt`)
- All your tests should be executed by using this command: `python3 -m doctest ./tests/*`
- All your modules should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')`
- All your classes should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)')`
- All your functions (inside and outside a class) should have a documentation (`python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)' and python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)')`
- A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified)
- We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case

Documentation
  ---------------------
- Do not use the words `inport` and `from` inside your comments, the checker will think you try to import some modules

Files
 ---------------------------
 The following files are scripts and programs written in Python
| Filename | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `0-read_file.py` | Write a function that reads a text file (`UTF8`) and prints it to stdout: |
| `1-write_file.py` | Write a function that writes a string to a text file (`UTF8`) and returns the number of characters written |
| `2-append_write.py` | Write a function that appends a string at the end of a text file (UTF8) and returns the number of characters added: |
| `3-to_json_string.py` |  Write a function that returns the JSON representation of an object (string): |
